										After scrolling through social media for
										a brief amount of time, it is pretty
										easy to come across a deepfake clip.
										Most of us see it as humorous, such as
										the clips of Obama playing with Joe
										Biden and Trump on Minecraft, which is
										obviously a deep fake video. However,
										not all such clips are fun and games.
										That is why today, Group 14 is going to
										go over deepfakes, voice cloning, and
										synthetic media, how it has harmed our
										community, as well as how the public is
										taking action against it.

										What Are These Technologies?
									</h1>
								</div>
								<div class="col-md-12">
									<p>
										To start, deepfakes, voice cloning, and
										synthetic media are terms used to
										describe video, images, and audio that
										have been artificially generated by
										artificial intelligence and/or machine
										learning models. Some examples include
										Computer Generated Imagery(CGI) in movie
										films to create monsters, cloning
										someone's voice to make them sing, and
										even generating different body parts
										onto other people. In the past, it was
										painfully obvious when these deepfakes
										were... fake... However, as time passes,
										artificial intelligence and machine
										learning are getting exponentially
										better, resulting in humans relying on
										artificial intelligence to tell them
										apart.

										The Problem
									</h1>
								</div>
								<div class="col-md-12">
									<p>
										Because these deepfakes are getting so
										realistic, they are starting to have
										real-world consequences for people. In
										the article, "Deepfakes and Synthetic
										Media: What are they and how are techUK
										members taking steps to tackle
										misinformation and fraud," they talk
										about many risks created by deepfakes,
										voice cloning, and synthetic media.
										Their biggest concerns were people being
										deepfaked and people being manipulated
										into believing deepfakes are real. For
										the former, there have been many
										instances of revenge pornography, where
										people are misusing artificial
										intelligence to create sexual content
										using the faces of friends, colleagues,
										or strangers and posting them online.
										While the latter, internal employees are
										being phished by scammers impersonating
										corporate executives, and
										politicians/businesses are being
										targeted, attempting to manipulate the
										media/market to ruin their
										reputation/brand.

										Case Study: Taylor Swift
									</h1>
								</div>

								<div class="col-md-8">
									<p>
										One case study involving the use of
										deepfake software for malicious intent
										is the Taylor Swift incident. According
										to the article, “Taylor Swift and the
										Dangers of Deepfake Pornography,” by the
										National Sexual Violence Research
										Center, the incident took place on
										January 24, 2024 in which
										sexually-explicit images of
										singer/songwriter Taylor Swift were
										shared across social media platforms,
										notably X. Though much of the images
										were promptly taken down from X’s
										platform, the emotional and
										psychological damage was already done.
										This incident reveals a large issue
										regarding the use of deepfake software
										for sexually explicit purposes which,
										according to the “Found through Google,
										bought with Visa and Mastercard: Inside
										the deepfake porn economy” by NBC News,
										accounts for
										<u>96% of the software’s use</u> . This
										issue not only poses a significant risk
										towards influential figures, but also
										unsuspecting citizens who’s likeness is
										readily available to be used by these
										technologies.

										Applying an Ethical framework

								<div class="col-md-12">
									<p>
										Our group came to the conclusion that
										deepfakes, voice cloning, and synthetic
										media are evolving too quickly and
										getting out of control. We agreed that
										the people designing these artificial
										intelligence and machine learning
										models, as well as the people using
										these models, should follow
										<b
											>John Rawls' Veil of Ignorance
											approach</b
										>. When developing/using these models,
										we need to keep in mind the harm they
										can bring to others, and that if other
										people were using these models, we would
										not want them to cause harm to us or our
										loved ones.

										Takeaways
									</h1>
								</div>

								<div class="col-md-12">
									<p>
										Some key takeaways to note are that
										there are actually some really good use
										cases for the technology behind these
										deepfakes. For example, also included in
										the article "Deepfakes and Synthetic
										Media: What are they and how are techUK
										members taking steps to tackle
										misinformation and fraud," is that the
										same technology is used for generating
										CGI/image assets for films and graphic
										designs, visualizing how
										furniture/homeware would look through
										Amazon's augmented reality, and allowing
										medical professionals to rehearse and
										practice procedures on virtual patients.
										Moreover, deepfake and voice cloning
										technologies can positively be used to
										preserve an individual’s likeness. For
										instance, artificial intelligence has
										been used to replicate, with permission,
										the voices of late actors such as James
										Earl Jones in Kenobi and Val Kilmer in
										Top Gun: Maverick. Furthermore, these
										case studies shine a positive light as
										to how deepfake/voice cloning softwares
										can be used as tools that provide value
										rather than stir controversies.

											>A little note, from group 14.
											Before writing this section, we had
											to educate ourselves on deepfakes,
											voice cloning, and synthetic media.
											We did so by having a few members
											find and take notes on articles
											online. Then, after compiling a
											Google Doc with our findings, we
											came up with the key points as well
											as the best ethical stance to take
											against it. Then all that was left
											was to write down what we learned
											and add to our collaborative
											insights.
