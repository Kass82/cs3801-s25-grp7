                                    With the rapid advancement of computing technology it has created a large environmental footprint. These environmental challenges include electronic waste (e-waste), high energy consumption, and resource depletion. The production and disposal of electronics contribute to pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, adding to the issue of climate change. As the demand for computing power increases, particularly with the rise of cloud computing and data centers, the environmental footprint of these technologies becomes more pronounced. Addressing the sustainability of computing is crucial for mitigating its negative impact on the environment and ensuring a more sustainable future.

                                        Data Centers that run, manage, and train AI model's like Google's Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT have substantial greenhouse gas emissions.
                                    The first solution that would come to mind would be to run these centers on renewable energy. In fact, some of these centers do run on solar and wind energy. 
                                    However, this also brings up the issue of the power usage of data centers themselves. Not only do they risk large amounts of greenhouse gases if used without renewable energy,
                                    they also use a large amount of power. The average data center consumes around 100 MW of power. This is enough energy to power hundreds of thousands of homes a year. 
                                    AI development has caused massive spikes in these companies' energy consumption. In 2023 Google had their data center’s yearly energy consumption increase by 17% (to a total of
                                    more than 24 terawatt hours) and their yearly greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions increase by 13% (to a total of 14.3 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents). Between 2019 and 2023 Google’s
                                    GHG emissions have increased by 48% and their energy consumption has doubled. Energy consumption on this scale brings up the sustainability and ethical question of whether or not
                                    we should be using this power solely to power these data centers.

                                        Another case study from 2022, “The Cloud Is Material” by Steven Gonzalez Monserrate explores the environmental impact of data centers that power cloud computing which are often overlooked,
                                    revealing their heavy reliance on physical resources. According to Monserrate’s five years of ethnographic research, the study highlights how a single data center can consume up to 5 million
                                    gallons of water per day for cooling purposes, contributing to local water shortages. Additionally, these data centers require immense energy, approximately 200 TWh (terawatt hours) annually,
                                    which contributes to almost 0.3% of global carbon emissions and more if extended to networked devices. A majority of the energy used is for cooling and ensuring system redundancy, and only 
                                    6-12 percent of that energy goes toward active computational tasks. The rest of the energy supports backup systems such as diesel generators and ensures that the redundant servers maintain
                                    24/7 availability. The increased carbon footprints, air pollution, and strain on local resources highlight a solution for more sustainable practice in cloud computing infrastructure. Ethically, the decision to maintain high availability
                                    at the cost of environmental harm raises questions about whether businesses are truly committed to sustainability. If businesses are truly committed to sustainability, they would invest
                                    in potential solutions such as renewable energy, energy efficient

In order to construct our document, we communicated with each other once a week to see each of our progress. Each person was assigned a section to research based on our topic. Alex took part in assisting with the takeaway section as well as finalizing the draft. Lester took initiative to ensure everyone was on track and (was our group leader that was chosen to update the github). He contributed to the document by taking over the practical takeaways and assisted with the explanation of our topic. Robert (got us started/gave us a base to work with) and contributed to each section in our toolkit. Paris contributed with the case studies as well as taking initiative on ensuring everyone is on task and demonstrating teamwork. Overall, we collectively agreed on the topic and the finalized document.
