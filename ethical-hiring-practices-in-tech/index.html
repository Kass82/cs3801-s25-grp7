										Ethical hiring practice in the tech industry refers to fair, transparent and inclusive processes for recruiting, selecting and onboarding new employees. These practices aim to ensure that all candidates are evaluated based on their qualifications, skills, and potential without bias or discrimination based on race, gender, age, disability, socio-economic background, or other related factors. 
										This issue is important because the tech industry has historically struggled with a lack of diversity and inclusion. Unconscious biases, non-inclusive job descriptions and hiring through personal networks can unintentionally exclude potential candidates from underrepresented groups. Additionally, some companies may engage in unethical behavior such as ghosting applicants, misrepresenting job roles, or using AI tools that reinforce biases.

		    						<p>
										To evaluate hiring practices in tech ethically, we can apply the framework Rawls’ Theory of Justice. From Rawls’s theory of justice, particularly the original position and the veil of ignorance, we are asked to design systems as if we don’t know our own social standing including race, gender, background, or ability. 
										If hiring systems were designed from this neutral standpoint, decision-makers would favor processes that protect the most vulnerable candidates and minimize the risk of bias. For example, hiring criteria would be clear and job relevant, and algorithmic tools would be audited for fairness, because no one would want to suffer discrimination from behind the veil. This theory reveals how current tech hiring often fails the fairness test by reinforcing systemic advantages. 		    						</p>

											<p class="image-text-text">Since 2014, a team from Amazon.com Inc. has been building a recruiting engine that will rate the job applicants’ resumes from one to five stars. And in 2015, the company found out that the system would frequently rate female applicants lower than their male counterparts.<br> 
												Since Amazon hopes the system will help them recruit favorable workers, the system was trained with resumes submitted to Amazon for software developer and technical roles from the past ten years, which are mainly from male applicants.
												Unknowingly, the system has been trained with biased data, as a result, the system will downgrade resumes that include some specific words, like “women’s”, as these words will appear less in a male’s resumes. 
												The system violated the Rawls’ Theory of Justice’s principle of equal liberty, as it fails to provide equal chances for female candidates.
