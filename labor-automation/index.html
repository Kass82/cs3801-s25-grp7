		    							The ethical issue of labor vs. automation examines the idea of replacing human workers with machines or AI systems. It brings up questions within society in regards to the responsibility, fairness, and the aftermath of it all with technology becoming the substitute for humans. Some of the concerns that this issue imposes would include job displacement, economic inequality, human dignity and purpose, and bias and fairness.
										The concern of job displacement talks about workers losing their jobs and their job roles being reduced. Economic inequality brings up the issue of distributing profits between companies and shareholders but the employees are a different story, signifying a disproportionate gap between the rich and the poor. Human dignity and purpose talks about the risks of automation taking over the workplace as it reduces any kind of human participation which would be considered a sense of dignity and purpose. Bias and fairness discusses the fact that automation can potentially create more bias and uncertainty when it comes to hiring, evaluating, or the distribution of resources.

		    							The Utilitarian Framework argues the greatest benefit for the greatest number of people. This makes the issue increasingly interesting as this framework can be applied both negatively and positively, but almost in a way that even balances itself.<br><br>

										Physically, automation benefits the main populace by allowing most dangerous or borderline inhuman jobs to be covered by entities capable of repair and/or replacement, if utilized correctly. This alleviates the danger posed to most of mankind thus making its application ethical. <br><br>

										However, removing these jobs from the market effectively shortens the diameter of the circle of wealth, thus making fewer richer and the majority in a financial struggle. By the framework this is effectively unethical. <br><br>

										This is where the balance reveals itself by applying these tactics only to positions that are entirely inhuman and expanding the job market elsewhere. This leaves safer jobs ready for those in need.

										</ul>
									</div>
		    						<p>
		    							Over the past decade, Amazon has integrated thousands of Kiva robots in its warehouses to do the work of what humans did before. This automation reduced order-fulfillment times by up to 50%. However, it led to an already dwindling Amazon workforce forcing layoffs. Amazon introduced programs that would train employees to perform maintenance on the robots however there's only so many spots that can realistically be applied to, critics argue these programmes have limited capacity and don’t fully offset the jobs lost.

											<li>Self-Checkout in Retail</li>
										</ul>
										
									</div>
		    						<p>
		    							Major grocery and retailers installed self-checkout machines to cut labor costs and speed up processes. Studies show these kiosks can reduce staffing needs by 10–15% per store. While some consumers appreciate the speed, many displaced cashiers face difficulty finding equivalent positions, particularly in regions with few alternative employers. Leading to unemployment or other unforeseen issues all because they didn't want to pay their workers.

		    						<p>
		    							Like everything in life, there are two sides to every coin, and labor vs. automation is no different. As technology advances, people find that machines and software replace many jobs, especially ones considered "low-skilled" or repetitive.
										On one side, automation replaces human labor, leading to unemployment and widening inequality. We've already seen this with factory jobs disappearing due to machines and retail or fast-food roles getting replaced by self-service systems. Older workers, especially those in their 50s and 60s, often struggle to retrain or re-enter the workforce. The harsh reality? The rich are cutting labor costs by handing simple jobs to robots, and people are paying the price.<br><br>

										Conversely, some argue that automation doesn't kill jobs; it transforms them. Automation removes tedious, manual tasks and frees people to focus on creative, strategic work. Efficiency can lead to business growth, and growth can lead to more jobs. But here's the catch: new roles need to be created, and people need access to retraining.<br><br>

										So the real question is: Are robots taking our jobs, or are greedy corporations hiding behind them? And is society even ethically ready for an automated future?

											"Towards the end of the Project, we all agreed to do research on the topic “labor vs automation,” and from that point we all divided the work that best suited each role. Austin handled the main question, Damarrion wanted to work on the utilitarian ideas, Breadon wanted to do research on real world examples and Cindrella wanted to turn everything into clear, helpful advice. How we collaborated for this question was a shared Google Doc because this made it much faster for us to drop in at any time to write, edit, and add sources. We used Discord to communicate with one another to complete tasks and to make sure that the roadmap was being completed."
