        <p>
          Accessibility and inclusive design are all about making technology in a way that it can be used by as many people as possible, regardless of their ability, age, language, or environment. That includes physically, visually, auditorily, cognitively, and neurologically disabled people, but also temporarily or situationally disabled people. Good design ensures technology is clear, easy to use, and understandable for everyone. For instance, written content should support text-to-speech tools so that blind users can listen instead of reading. Similarly, users who are unable to use a mouse should be capable of using a keyboard only or be able to utilize voice control. Accessibility here caters to all.
        </p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 40px; color: #333;">Ethical Framework: Utilitarianism</h3>
        <p>
          Utilitarianism is a moral framework that is interested in creating the greatest good for the greatest number of people. It aims to maximize total happiness and reduce suffering or harm. This framework is very much in line with the principles of inclusive and accessible design. Designing for accessibility benefits not only individuals with permanent impairments but also those with temporary or situational requirements, such as a person with a broken arm or one working with a smartphone in sunlight or background noise. Inclusive design fosters equity, increases user satisfaction, and generates improved well-being for society by making more products and services accessible to more people.
        </p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 40px; color: #333;">Case Study: Education Platforms</h3>
        <p>
          Consider an online learning platform at a university. If it isn’t accessible, blind students may struggle to access lecture materials or submit assignments. Platforms like Canvas have faced criticism for not meeting accessibility standards. Improvements like screen reader support, alt-text for images, and keyboard navigation can ensure equal access to education for all students.
        </p>
        <p>
          This integration also benefits students with dyslexia and other learning challenges. A study conducted by Sekovanić et al. at the University of Zagreb focused on adapting an e-learning course with various media (like videos and images) within Moodle to serve dyslexic learners better. To improve usability, the course design included simplified layouts, consistent navigation, and multimedia content. The study discovered, through usability testing with a student with dyslexia, that these adaptations significantly enhanced the learning experience and allowed the student to engage with the material more effectively. These accessibility features, such as screen reader support, alt-text for images, and keyboard navigation, are not just tailored to one specific group but are valuable for all students. They provide multiple ways for students to engage with the content, allowing everyone, regardless of ability, to interact with the material in a way that suits their learning style.

        <h3 style="margin-top: 40px; color: #333;">Context from real systems</h3>
        <p>
          The accessibility factor of websites is not just an added bonus meant to improve the quality of life for some users, as many inexperienced developers may think of it as, but rather a necessity of any modern software. Across sectors like retail, government, education, healthcare, and many others, developers must prioritize implementing accessibility in their software. Without it, large numbers of users are left unable to access essential online services and tools. For example, Google Maps has added wheelchair-accessible routes to ensure users with mobility challenges can more confidently use the application. Beyond excluding users, the absence of accessibility also creates serious legal and compliance risks, exposing organizations to lawsuits, fines, and reputational damage down the line. One such example was when Domino’s Pizza was sued for failing to make its website and app accessible to blind users relying on screen readers.

        <h3 style="margin-top: 40px; color: #333;">Checklist for Inclusive Design</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Can the system be used without a mouse?</li>
          <li>Can all actions be completed with a keyboard?</li>
          <li>Is the content available in both visual and auditory forms?</li>
          <li>Are videos captioned?</li>
          <li>Does text have high color contrast?</li>
          <li>Do images have descriptive alt-text?</li>
          <li>Are headings structured with semantic tags (like &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;)?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 40px; color: #333;">Guiding Questions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Can this system be used without sight?</li>
          <li>Can it be used with one hand?</li>
          <li>Is the content understandable to all users?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 40px; color: #333;">Author’s Note</h3>
        <p>
          Our group collaborated by first brainstorming various ethical issues in technology and then choosing accessibility because of its widespread importance. Each member contributed examples from their experiences and helped research guidelines and frameworks. We found this topic meaningful because accessibility affects a wide range of users and is often overlooked in tech design. Through our research, we realized how essential inclusive practices are in creating fair and usable systems. This project helped us see the real-world impact of thoughtful, accessible design.
