              <h2>Accessibility & Inclusive Design</h2>
              <p>Accessibility and inclusive design focuses on creating technology that is usable by the widest range of people. This includes people with disabilities, different ages, languages, and environments. Good design ensures technology is clear, easy to use, and readable for all. For example, text should support text-to-speech so that blind users can listen instead of reading. Likewise, users who cannot use a mouse should be able to navigate using only a keyboard or voice commands.</p>

              <h3>Ethical Framework: Utilitarianism</h3>
              <p>Utilitarianism is an ethical framework that aims to maximize overall happiness and minimize harm. Accessible design aligns with this approach because it helps not just individuals with permanent disabilities but also temporary and situational users—such as someone with a broken arm or someone using a phone in a noisy place. Inclusive design increases satisfaction, supports fairness, and serves the common good.</p>

              <h3>Case Study: Education Platforms</h3>
              <p>Consider an online learning platform at a university. If it isn’t accessible, blind students may struggle to access lecture materials or submit assignments. Platforms like Canvas have faced criticism for not meeting accessibility standards. Improvements like screen reader support, alt-text for images, and keyboard navigation can ensure equal access to education for all students.</p>

              <h3>Checklist for Inclusive Design</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Can the system be used without a mouse?</li>
                <li>Can all actions be completed with a keyboard?</li>
                <li>Is the content available in both visual and auditory forms?</li>
                <li>Are videos captioned?</li>
                <li>Does text have high color contrast?</li>
                <li>Do images have descriptive alt-text?</li>
                <li>Are headings structured with semantic tags (like &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;)?</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Guiding Questions</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Can this system be used without sight?</li>
                <li>Can it be used with one hand?</li>
                <li>Is the content understandable to all users?</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Author’s Note</h3>
              <p>Our group collaborated by first brainstorming various ethical issues in technology, then choosing accessibility because of its widespread importance. Each member contributed examples from their experiences and helped research guidelines and frameworks.</p>
